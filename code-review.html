<h1>Code Review</h1>
<p>Code reivews are a critical process during the software development cycle when making enhancements. Code reviews are a method of looking over the code line by line, either via peer review 
  or looking over your own code. What this does is help to locate areas for improvement, be it fixing slight issues to finding sections of code that could use improvements, or even looking at 
  how to add in new functionality and how best to make it work with your existing application. Peer review is even more helpful given that a second eye looking can sometimes find something 
  that was missed, since as a developer we tend to see our code flawless at times, and we need to be aware at times improvements are always possible.
</p>
<p>
  Below is the code review done for the two artifacts used for this ePortfolio.  First is the Task Scheduler and then the Monitoring System, both reviewing the current iteration and their 
  functionality, but also how best to move forward with the enhancement process.
