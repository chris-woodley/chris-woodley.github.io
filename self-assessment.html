<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
<p>My path through the Computer Science program began in January 2018. My passion for computer programming drove me to fill in the gaps in my previous knowledge and helped to strengthen my 
  skills all the more. My passion for computer programming began several years ago, using languages such as Basic, Pascal, and C++ to build simple programs to test out how things worked.
   Since then, Iâ€™ve utilized my skills in programming to help locate solutions to work related issues through the means of software development, generating applications to be used to help 
   streamline processes and build permanent solutions that are utilized to this day in my company. The path to my degree has been stemmed mainly due to my wish to truly devote myself to 
   software development, taking challenges found with nothing more than the problem and requirements, and help to develop solutions that can help resolve more issues.
</p>
<p>
  My time in the Computer Science program have aided me in expanding my knowledge not in various skillsets, from learning new programming languages, to developing better critical thinking 
  skills and putting new methodologies of development at my disposal. 
  </p>
<p><h2>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h2>
<br>Throughout this program, the knowledge that development is more than just one person coding has been a thought that has helped in identifying means of working better within a team
 environment. Utilization of code hosting platforms such as GitHub has helped to work with a team by having a single place where all work can be stored, allowing for review of the changes 
 being made, identify conflicts, and work through with the team to determine the best course of action. Below is an example showing not only the handling of branches within a team repository
 , but also showing a review of code, adding in detail to better explain what has been located and any changes that would need to be made. 
<br>
<br>
In addition to this, utilization of comments and proper naming schemes are helpful in assisting those having to modify and upgrade the source code by not only outlining the main objective
 of a given set of code, but to do so on a line-by-line basis, explaining the intention and expected results. In so doing, the source code is much easier to not only understand, but to
  traverse, and identify where adjustments and updates will be needed. 
<br>
<br>
During my tenure in the Computer Science program, I was able to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision
 making in the field of computer science by utilizing these very tools. With GitHub, I was able to ensure that my work was properly aligned in individual branches and was properly reviewed
  by others prior to pushing into the main branch to ensure that the code was not only properly vetted, but also that there were no conflicts within it. This was helped by means of proper
   comments and naming schemes to ensure that the source code was simple to follow for those reviewing, making for a more streamlined approach.
