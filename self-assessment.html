<p><h2>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h2>
<br>Throughout this program, the knowledge that development is more than just one person coding has been a thought that has helped in identifying means of working better within a team
 environment. Utilization of code hosting platforms such as GitHub has helped to work with a team by having a single place where all work can be stored, allowing for review of the changes 
 being made, identify conflicts, and work through with the team to determine the best course of action. Below is an example showing not only the handling of branches within a team repository
 , but also showing a review of code, adding in detail to better explain what has been located and any changes that would need to be made.

In addition to this, utilization of comments and proper naming schemes are helpful in assisting those having to modify and upgrade the source code by not only outlining the main objective of a given set of code, but to do so on a line-by-line basis, explaining the intention and expected results.
